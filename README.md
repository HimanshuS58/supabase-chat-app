# Supabase chat app
This project is a real-time chat application built with React, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS, supporting live messaging, user presence tracking, and a responsive user interface.
It leverages Supabase Realtime Channels for instant message broadcasting and Google OAuth for secure user authentication.

⚠️ Google OAuth is configured for this deployment. To run locally, you must configure your own Google OAuth credentials and Supabase environment variables.
